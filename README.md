# FlipPic -- "Your Front/Back Camera App"

This innovative front/back camera app lets you take both a selfie and a snapshot with a single touch. Swap live previews from your iPhone's FaceTime HD and iSight cameras. After pressing the shutter button, FlipPic lets you apply custom layouts and filters then save or share with friends on social media.

Written entirely in Swift, Apple's modern programming language, FlipPic is the culminating group project for four DevMountain iOS student developers who completed 12 weeks of immersive coding classes. 

Skillfully led by mentor Skyler Tanner, FlipPic's student developer team consists of Ben Patch, Andrew Porter, Eric Mead, and Paul Adams.
