# DevMountain iOS Immersive Cohort 4 Group Project

An Innovative Camera App Coming Soon to the  App Store!

Take both a selfie and a snapshot with a single touch. Swap live previews from your iPhone's FaceTime HD and iSight cameras. After pressing the shutter button, this app lets you apply custom layouts and filters then save or share with friends on social media.

Written entirely in Swift, Appleʼs modern programming language, it is the culminating group project for four DevMountain iOS student developers who completed 12 weeks of immersive coding classes. 

Skillfully led by mentor Skyler Tanner, FlipPic's student developer team consists of Ben Patch, Andrew Porter, Eric Mead, and Paul Adams.
